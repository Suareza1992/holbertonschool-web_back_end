This directory is dedicated to learning the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) programming.

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification. It introduced many new features and enhancements to JavaScript, making it more powerful and expressive.

Some of the key features introduced in ES6 include:
- Arrow functions
- Classes and modules
- Template literals
- Destructuring assignment
- Default parameters
- Spread syntax
- Promises and async/await
- And much more!

By exploring the code examples and exercises in this directory, you will gain a solid foundation in ES6 programming and be able to leverage its features to write more efficient and maintainable JavaScript code.

Happy learning!
