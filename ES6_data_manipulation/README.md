# ES6 JavaScript Data Structures Learning Project

This directory is dedicated to learning and exploring data structures using ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) JavaScript. The focus is on understanding how to implement and use various data structures effectively in JavaScript, leveraging the new syntax and features introduced in ES6. This includes but is not limited to arrays, maps, sets, objects, and more complex structures like graphs and trees.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide and practical examples to help learners grasp the concepts of data structures in JavaScript, enhancing their ability to write efficient and scalable code.
