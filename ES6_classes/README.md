# ES6 JavaScript Classes Learning Project

This directory contains a collection of files and examples that serve as a learning project for understanding and using ES6 JavaScript classes. The purpose of this project is to provide practical examples and exercises to help understand the syntax, features, and use cases of classes in modern JavaScript, as introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). Below is an overview of the key files in this directory and their significance:

- `classBasics.js`: Demonstrates the basic syntax for defining and using classes in JavaScript, including constructors, methods, and properties.

- `inheritance.js`: Shows how to use inheritance in JavaScript classes to create a hierarchy of classes that inherit properties and methods from one another.

- `staticMethods.js`: Contains examples of how to define and use static methods in a class, which are methods that can be called on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class.

- `gettersSetters.js`: Illustrates the use of getter and setter methods in classes to control access to the properties of an object.

- `9-groceries_list.js`: An example that uses classes to model a simple grocery list, demonstrating how classes can be used to encapsulate and manage related data and behavior.

The files in this directory are intended to be studied and run individually to understand different aspects of JavaScript classes. They provide a hands-on way to learn about one of the most powerful features introduced in ES6, which is essential for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
